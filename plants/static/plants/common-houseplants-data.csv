"Ficus Benjamina","Weeping Fig","
                                                        One of the best known and widely used houseplants. This is for a good reason, glossy leaves grow in profusion creating the classic indoor tree. Keep out of droughts and away from radiators to avoid the 'weeping' and keep the fig. Over winter it will need watering less frequently.

"Aeschynanthus Marmoratus","Zebra Basket Vine","
                                                        This is a lovely dark green trailing house plant with oval shaped leaves with wonderful detailing in purple. Perfect for hanging baskets. The foliage really is stunning enough but it also flowers.

"Zamioculcas Zamifolia","ZZ Plant","
                                                        Only recently has this plant been seen in the UK (Its name is heard even less!). Zamioculcas is beginning to find itself brought into offices by interior landscapers, probably due to its affinity with modern design.","https://www.houseofplants.co.uk/Resources/800temp/Zanzibar_zamiifolia_detail.jpg","High"
